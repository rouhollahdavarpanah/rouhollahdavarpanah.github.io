    summary: |
         Throughout my undergraduate studies, I successfully completed foundational coursework in agriculture, environmental science, and water engineering.
         Fueled by a profound interest in my discipline, I resolved to pursue advanced studies at the Master's level. Remarkably, I achieved the 9th rank in the highly competitive M.Sc. entrance exam of Iran, securing a full scholarship for advanced studies at Tarbiat Modares University.
         I defended my thesis with distinction, and subsequently, I have remained steadfastly committed to sustained research pursuits in the realms of water resources engineering and environmental science. 
         My scholarly contributions materialized in the publication of two peer-reviewed articles, prominently featured in esteemed journals such as the Journal of Hydrology.
         My professional trajectory has been enriched through hands-on experiences in hydrology, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), flood management, and drought mitigation. These experiences have not only honed my technical acumen but have also deepened my fervor for engaging in applied research in these pivotal domains. 
         In a broader sense, my academic aspirations revolve around delving into the interconnections among water, food, energy, and ecosystems. I am driven to leverage my analytical prowess to proactively address challenges pertaining to water, food, and energy, with the overarching goal of positively influencing the sustainability and resilience of human-environment complex systems.

education:
    title: Education
    info:
      - degree: M.Sc. in Water Engineering and Management – Water and Hydraulic Structures
        university: Tarbiat Modares University
        time: Sept. 2014 – May. 2018
        details: During my master’s program, I learned numerical modeling and how to calibrate, validate, and utilize hydrological and hydraulic models including SWAT, WEAP, HecRas, and SWMM. In my thesis project, I simulated and optimized the operation of a complex irrigation network using a hydrodynamic model (ICSS) in a semi-arid area experiencing water bankruptcy. I assessed different hydraulic operation methods for optimizing water delivery in irrigation networks, and utilized machine learning algorithms for crop yield prediction.

      - degree: B.Sc. in Water Science and Engineering – Irrigation and Drainage
        university: Jahrom University
        time: Sept. 2010 - July. 2014
        details: Through my undergraduate studies, I completed several courses in agriculture and water resources management and actively participated in volunteer activities at Jahrom University as the secretary of the water scientific association. In addition, I have served as the chief editor of a monthly scientific magazine for two years, where we would graphically report the most recent scientific achievements and technologies in water engineering and management. In the last year, under the guidance of our faculty members, I took the Iran M.Sc. degree entrance exam and achieved the 9th rank among over 5,000 candidates. Thus, I opted to pursue my studies at Tarbiat Modares University, known for its exceptional water engineering and management department in Iran.
